        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>Large software projects often track hundreds of thousands of bugs over time. Bugs can cause software to behave in unintended and unexpected ways, leading to an estimated annual cost of $59.5 billion.</p>
        
        <h2>Bug Triaging</h2>
        <p>Bugs are assigned to developers through a process known as bug triaging, which involves maunually reviewing bugs to prioritize work towards fixing defects causing the malfunctions. Some bugs are need immediate attention, while others are lower priority and therefore get carried over to future software updates. The success of the triaging process depends on whether the prioritized bugs are actually fixed or not.</p>
        
        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <p>Bug triaging is very resource-intensive when it comes to time and labor if done manually. Understanding factors which contribute to whether or not a bug ends up getting fixed can help a company effectively automate the bug triaging process which can help developers be more productive and efficient with their time and efforts. It can also help set the expectations of the bug reporter when they first report a bug, allowing highly unlikely-to-be-fixed bugs to be flagged or closed, and users advised of appropriate workarounds. This can lead to an all-around better experience for both users of the software and the developers alike.</p>
        
        <h2>Task</h2>
        <p>The task is to explore the Eclipse defect tracking dataset to develop insights into the factors that affect the likelihood of a bug being fixed. The goal is then to develop a prediction model for which bugs would be fixed.</p>
        
        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective is to create a prediction model using any software and modeling approach, working with the provided dataset. For the purposes of our project, we will stick to mainly logistic regression, logistic regression with lasso regularization, bagging, random forests, and boosting models. We can aslo consider other factors such as past success rate of a bug assignee, the reputation of a bug reporter, bug report edits, bug reassignments, bug re-openings, the time a bug has been open, the software module assigned, and social relationships between bug participants.</p>
